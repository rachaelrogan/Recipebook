- getRowResults - put everything into its own object - have it completely parsed instead of a string
- think and plan more before coding
	- what kind of queries we will need
	- how similar funcationality will need to be used
- the mainIngredient thing was a pain in the butt
- forgot about the whole overloading methods thing so I ended up changing
  all these references...
- separate functions for each part of the query would have been a good idea
